# TODOs

-   end game
-   wining: put in check for total number won (=== cards in hand) with error message
-   create an EDIT page to fix past scores
-   winning page: flash clicked button red if not valid to click it (max points given out)
-   github and vercel publish
-   top level menu with naviation (cancel game, edit scores,)
-   google analytics
-   X bidding: add final bid number restriction
-   X remove player
-   X can't play with only one player
-   X tell each player during bidding how far behind the next person/leader they are
-   X Bid page. "wait turn" after bidding should be "done" - Made it "wait" instead, too hard
